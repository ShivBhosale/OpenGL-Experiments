Challenge 001 is to make a ice rpg game framework in C++ and record all your knowledge here. The framework will only consist of a nice isometric GUI. Haha that's all
------
Reasons to choose C++ is because it is very close to the hardware and I really wanna learn it. Haha

------
I will first require an engine structure.

- game will have a start screen. A Menu
-- Menu will have 2 options: Play and Settings
--- Settings will only allow sound control for now
---- Play will allow the users to choose from a save state. N allowed.

The engine needs to have graphics, but I think it will first have a neat code structure. The raw data will then be displayed onto a GUI.
Will require a template game loop as well.

What will be in the game loop: Game
What wont be in the game loop: Menu Screen -X Skipped for now. Don't need a menu screen. It's for losers
-----

Settings: Lua is used widely for storing config settings
Saving a game: Serialization is needed.

PROGRAMMING CONCEPTS LEARNED!
=============================

- char comparision has to done as var == 'c' and not as var == "c". Second is interpreted as a cahr-pointer comparision.
- Inorder to run a GLUT code run the following command: g++ -std=c++14 file.cpp -lGL -lGLU -lglut
-- That helps to link all the libraries. "-std=c++14" is optional
